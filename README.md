# Heart Disease Prediction with Neural Networks

**Description:** Used a deep learning model to classify whether a patient is likely to develop heart disease using structured data.

**Tools Used:** TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, Scikit-learn

## ðŸ“Œ What I Did
- Normalised the heart disease dataset
- Built a neural network with dropout regularisation
- Trained and validated the model with performance curves
- Reported classification accuracy and confusion matrix
